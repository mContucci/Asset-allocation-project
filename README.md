# Asset allocation
This project, conducted in May 2023, is a collaborative effort by Marco Contucci and Diego Cisbani as part of our university coursework.

## Project Overview
In just 5 days, we conducted a comprehensive study on asset allocation using various techniques on selected stocks from the Italian stock market. The project's MATLAB codebase can be found in the `\Code` directory, and the formal report, prepared using LaTeX, is available in the PDF file named `Report.pdf`.

## Asset Allocation Study
Our study focuses on asset allocation strategies, aiming to optimize investment portfolios with a particular emphasis on Italian stock market assets. We have explored various techniques and methodologies to create well-diversified portfolios for better risk management and returns.
